This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom image manipulation functions.  The issue arises when trying to access image data (e.g., using `canvas.toDataURL()`) after taking a picture with the camera.  The `uri` from the camera is initially available, but attempts to read the image data using standard methods fail, producing an empty or incorrect result.  The problem seems linked to the asynchronous nature of fetching the image data from the Expo camera and the timing of accessing it.
